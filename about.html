                One of the most well-known, if anonymous, street artists working
                today is Banksy (British, born c. 1974). Banksy, the alias
                adopted by the artist, preserves his anonymity and remains
                largely unknown to the public the specifics of his life.
                Initially, he gained fame for his graffiti, which incorporates
                spray paint and stenciling methods, infused with satirical
                social commentary and humor, with advertising, political and
                contemporary imagery. During the mid-1990s, his work first
                started appearing on walls in and around Bristol and the
                Shoreditch district of London, and since then he has placed
                photographs on the sides of corporate buildings, billboards, and
                the wall of the Israeli West Bank.
              </p>
              <p>
                The release of a new Banksy work often includes pranks or
                performance. For eg, in museums such as the Tate Modern in
                London or the Paris Louvre, he secretly added his own pieces,
                sneaking them in under a coat and discreetly adding them to a
                wall. He also opened gallery shows to the public with
                specially-bred rats running around the room, and once inserted
                into California's Disneyland theme park an inflatable doll
                dressed as a Guantanamo Bay prisoner.

                Banksy created a large-scale installation in 2015, titled
                Dismaland Bemusement Park, an interactive and fully functional
                amusement park featuring political commentary on the
                distribution of wealth, sexism, and the government of the United
                Kingdom. The park ran between August and September 2015, and was
                financed by Banksy alone. Banksy produces works for many
                charities, in addition to his daily graffiti activity, and
                regularly opens exhibitions to diverse audiences and critical
                acclaim. He lives and works in England.
