                Banksy, with two other artists known as Kato and Tes, began as a
                freehand graffiti artist in 1990-1994 as part of Bristol's
                DryBreadZ Crew (DBZ). He was influenced by local artists and
                with Nick Walker, Inkie and 3D, his work was part of the wider
                Bristol underground scene. During this time he met Steve
                Lazarides, a photographer from Bristol, who began selling
                Banksy's work and later became his agent. By 2000, after
                discovering how much less time it took to finish a work, he had
                turned to the art of stenciling. He says he turned to
                stencilling while hiding under a rubbish lorry from the police,
                when he found the stencilled serial number and he soon became
                more widely noticed for his art around Bristol and London by
                using this technique. In the 1990s, he was the goalie for the
                Easton Cowboys and Cowgirls football team, and in 2001, he
                toured Mexico with the club. The Mild Mild West, painted in 1997
                to cover ads for a former lawyer's office on Stokes Croft in
                Bristol, was Banksy's first known large wall mural. It shows a
                teddy bear lobbing three riot police with a Molotov cocktail.

                Banksy's stencils, often paired with slogans, feature striking
                and humorous images. Typically, the message is anti-war,
                anti-capitalist, or anti-establishment. Rats, apes, policemen,
                soldiers, girls, and the elderly are often the topics.
              </p>

                In July 2011, after the premises became a Muslim cultural
                centre, one of Banksy's early pieces, The Hedgehog, which had
                been a prominent landmark on the exterior wall of a former
                social club in Eastville for over ten years, was inadvertently
                painted over.
